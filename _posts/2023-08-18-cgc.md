The Wagner Lab roadtripped to beautiful St. Louis, Missouri for the [Cancer Genomics Consortium 2023 Annual Meeting](https://cancergenomics.org/meetings/cgc_annual_meeting_2023.php). Alex moderated a workshop and a panel on cancer bioinformatics, and lab members gave lightning and platform talks covering ongoing research projects:

* Anastasia Smith, *"Gene normalizer: a tool to resolve genetic ambiguity through data harmonization"*
* James Stevenson, *"Overcoming challenges in semantic alignment of therapeutics knowledge using TheraPy"*
* Jeremy Arbesfeld, *"Mapping variants from multiplex assays of variant effect (MAVEs) to human reference sequences"*
* Katie Stahl, *"Fusion curation interface: An educational tool to explore a unified framework for representing & curating gene fusions"*
* Kori Kuzma, *"Resolving ambiguities in copy number variation representation"*
* Wes Goar, *"Implementing the ClinGen/CGC/VICC Oncogenicity Guidelines in a pediatric variant classification workflow"*

Congratulations to Katie, James, and Jeremy, who received travel awards for outstanding abstracts!

The lab also attended the [CIViC/ClinGen/CGC Knowledgebase Hackathon and Jamboree](https://www.cancergenomics.org/docs/cgc-hackathon-handout_2023.pdf), which proved to be fruitful and productive. Thanks to Wes, Kori, Anastasia, and Jeremy for their work on the organizing committee.
