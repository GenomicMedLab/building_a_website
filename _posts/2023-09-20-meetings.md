It was a busy September for the Wagner Lab!

## AGBT Precision Health 2023

Wes and Matt embarked to sunny San Diego for the [Advances in Genome Biology and Technology (AGBT) Precision Health Meeting](https://www.agbt.org/events/precision-health/).

## Biocommons Hackathon and GA4GH Plenary

Meanwhile, Kori, Katie, and James flew to ~~foggy~~ smoky San Francisco for the 2023 [Biocommons](https://www.biocommons.org/) Hackathon, where they contributed code and documentation to projects like [UTA](https://github.com/biocommons/uta), [HGVS](https://github.com/biocommons/hgvs), [VRS-Python]({{ vrs_python.url }}), and [AnyVar]({{ anyvar.url }}). They were then joined for the [11th GA4GH Plenary Meeting](https://www.ga4gh.org/event/11th-plenary/) by Daniel, who helped present the lab's ongoing work in standardizing [variation representation]({{ vrs_project.url }}).

Many thanks to Kori for leading Hackathon planning!
