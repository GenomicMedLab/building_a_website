It was a busy September for the Wagner Lab!

## AGBT Precision Health 2023

Wes and Matt embarked to sunny San Diego for the [Advances in Genome Biology and Technology (AGBT) Precision Health Meeting](https://www.agbt.org/events/precision-health/).

## Biocommons Hackathon and GA4GH Plenary

Meanwhile, Kori, Katie, and James flew to foggy San Francisco for the 2023 [Biocommons](https://www.biocommons.org/) Hackathon. They were then joined by Daniel for the [11th GA4GH Plenary Meeting](https://www.ga4gh.org/event/11th-plenary/), who helped present the lab's ongoing work on [variation representation]({{ vrs_project.url }}).

Many thanks to Kori for leading Hackathon planning!
