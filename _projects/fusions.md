Curating gene fusion events from clinical testing and the literature involves knowledge of several related components. Knowledge of the gene partners involved, required functional domains or exons, expected orientation of the genes involved, associated chromosomal events, method of detection, and additional alterations associated with these events all influence the way a gene fusion is described and interpreted.
