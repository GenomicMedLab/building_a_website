name: Variation Representation
---
Between any two individuals, the human genome differs by around 0.1% — meaning each individual has millions of sites in their genome that collectively make them unique. The impact of genetic variation on human health and disease is complex and immense; in order to accelerate research and advance patient care, it is vital to unlock the potential of the world’s genetic variation data and exchange it reliably across diagnostic labs, electronic health records (EHRs), research institutions, and knowledge-bases. Developed by the GA4GH Genomic Knowledge Standards (GKS) Work Stream, the Variation Representation Specification (VRS) is a computational “language” that enables consistent communication across these systems.
