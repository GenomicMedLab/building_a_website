name: Knowledgebase Integration
---
The availability of high-throughput, low-cost sequencing has transformed the landscape of biomedical research by dramatically expanding our capacity to interrogate the sequence of the human genome. Consequently, there has been an explosion of biomedical literature describing the role of specific genomic variants and their impact on human diseases.

The knowledgebase integration project originated from the GA4GH Genotype-to-Phenotype framework. The intent of the project is to leverage the collective knowledge of the disparate existing resources of the VICC to improve the comprehensiveness of clinical interpretation of genomic variation. An ongoing goal will be to provide and improve upon standards and guidelines by which other groups with clinical interpretation data may make it accessible and visible to the public. Our initial harmonization effort (the VICC Meta-Knowledgebase) and associated analysis was recently described in our flagship manuscript in Nature Genetics.
