The recently developed ClinGen/CGC/VICC SOP for the classification of oncogenicity of somatic variants in cancer defined the classification of gene fusions as out of scope, due to nuances specific to such alterations. Similarly, the cross-consortia (ClinGen, CGC, VICC) gene fusion characterization project (fusions.cancervariants.org) is specifying the minimal information for gene fusions as a class of variation but intentionally excludes guidance on the clinical classifications of those variants.
