The Gene Normalizer provides tools for resolving ambiguous human gene references to consistently-structured, normalized terms. For gene concepts extracted from [NCBI Gene](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/), [Ensembl](https://useast.ensembl.org/index.html), and [HGNC](https://www.genenames.org/), it designates a [CURIE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURIE), and provides additional metadata like current and previously-used symbols, aliases, database cross-references and associations, and coordinates.
