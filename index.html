<p>We work to improve the actionability and throughput of genomic variant interpretation. Our group researches and develops methods, tools and standards for the exchange and application of biomedical evidence to inform clinical decisionmaking.</p>

<p>Translation of observed changes in patient DNA into actionable clinical findings requires many hours of effort from variant scientists and clinical lab directors. The majority of this time is spent on aggregating evidence relevant to observed variations and applying that evidence in the context of other medical observations about a patient. Methods are needed to streamline this process by collecting, identifying, and prioritizing the most relevant evidence given the clinical context for a patient.</p>

<p>To these ends, our team coordinates with the interdisciplinary clinical and scientific expertise at the <a href="https://www.nationwidechildrens.org/specialties/institute-for-genomic-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steve and Cindy Rasmussen Institute for Genomic Medicine</a> at <a href="https://www.nationwidechildrens.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nationwide Children’s Hospital</a> to target key areas for growth and application of the Institute’s clinical evidence databases. The lab also collaborates with multiple international genomic knowledge sharing consortia, including the <a href="https://clinicalgenome.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen)</a>, the <a href="https://www.ga4gh.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH)</a> and the <a href="https://cancervariants.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Variant Interpretation for Cancer Consortium (VICC)</a>, to develop these methods, standards and tools.</p>
