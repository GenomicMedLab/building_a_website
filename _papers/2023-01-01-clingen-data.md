The Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) serves as an authoritative resource on the clinical relevance of genes and variants. In order to support our curation activities and to disseminate our findings to the community, we have developed a Data Platform of informatics resources backed by standardized data models. In this workshop we demonstrate our publicly available resources including curation interfaces, (Variant Curation Interface, CIViC), supporting infrastructure (Allele Registry, Genegraph), and data models (SEPIO, GA4GH VRS, VA).
