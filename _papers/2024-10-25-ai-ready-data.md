Biomedical research and clinical practice are in the midst of a transition toward significantly increased use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods. These advances promise to enable qualitatively deeper insight into complex challenges formerly beyond the reach of analytic methods and human intuition while placing increased demands on ethical and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), given the opaque nature of many deep learning methods. The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) has initiated a significant research and development program, Bridge2AI, aimed at producing new "flagship" datasets designed to support AI/ML analysis of complex biomedical challenges, elucidate best practices, develop tools and standards in AI/ML data science, and disseminate these datasets, tools, and methods broadly to the biomedical community. An essential set of concepts to be developed and disseminated in this program along with the data and tools produced are criteria for AI-readiness of data, including critical considerations for XAI and ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) of AI technologies. NIH Bridge to Artificial Intelligence (Bridge2AI) Standards Working Group members prepared this article to present methods for assessing the AI-readiness of biomedical data and the data standards perspectives and criteria we have developed throughout this program. While the field is rapidly evolving, these criteria are foundational for scientific rigor and the ethical design and application of biomedical AI methods.
