We are writing on behalf of a cross-consortia effort for the characterization of gene fusions, as driven by mutual interest from the following working groups:

* The Clinical Genome (ClinGen) Somatic Cancer Clinical Domain Working Group (https://clinicalgenome.org/working-groups/clinical-domain/somatic-cancer-cdwg/)
* The Cancer Genomics Consortium (CGC) (https://cancergenomics.org/)
* The Cytogenetics Committee of the College of American Pathologists (CAP) and the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) (https://www.cap.org/member-resources/councils-committees/cap-acmg-cytogenetics-committee/)
* The Variant Interpretation for Cancer Consortium (VICC), a Driver Project of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) (cancervariants.org/projects/fusions)

Our efforts are informed by voluntary participation of interested members from these groups to reach consensus on disambiguating the many complex molecular events that constitute gene fusions and the molecular rearrangements that drive them. The content of this correspondence is based upon our in-draft guidelines for gene fusion characterization and reflects the consensus perspective of the participants, which (as a developing work) has not yet been evaluated for formal endorsement by the above professional societies.

Recently, Bruford et al. published the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) recommendations for the designation of gene fusions [1]. Recommendations by the HGNC, as a globally-recognized authority in the designation of human gene symbols, have provided a much-needed foundation for a unified nomenclature for human gene fusions, and we would like to congratulate the authors on this valuable publication. The primary recommendation from this manuscript is for a double-colon (“::”) delimiter for indicating fusions. This recommendation is conceptually aligned with other community recommendations, including the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature guidelines for genomic rearrangements [2], the HUGO Genome Variation Society nomenclature [3] for fusion transcripts, and guidelines for gene fusions in other organisms [4]. Our consortium thus supports the use of double-colon for fusion representation, and we will foster implementation of this HGNC recommendation within our participating organizations and the broader genetics community.

We now look to opportunities enabled by the HGNC gene fusion nomenclature recommendations to share our proposals for future expansion and refinement.
