There are thousands of distinct disease entities and concepts, each of which are known by different and sometimes contradictory names. The Monarch Initiative aims to integrate genotype, phenotype, and disease knowledge from a large variety of sources in support of improved diagnostics and mechanism discovery through various algorithms and tools. However, the lack of a unified system for managing disease entities poses a major challenge for both machines and humans to predict causes and treatments for disease. The multitude of disease resources have not been well coordinated nor computationally integrated. Furthermore, the classification of phenotypes and their association with diseases is another source of disagreement across sources. The Human Phenotype Ontology has helped to standardize phenotypic features across knowledge sources, but there was no equivalent computationally-harmonized disease ontology. To address these problems, a community of disease resources worked together to create the Mondo Disease Ontology as an open, community-driven ontology that integrates key medical and biomedical terminologies and is iteratively and regularly updated via manual curation and through synchronization with external sources using a Bayesian algorithm. Mondo supports disease data integration to improve diagnosis, treatment, and translational research. It records the sources of all data and is continually updated, making it suitable for research and clinical applications that require up-to-date disease knowledge.
