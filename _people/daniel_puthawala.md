Daniel Puthawala, PhD, does formal modeling and schema development for the Wagner lab to help develop tools and standards for advancing genomics research and clinical analysis pipelines. A Linguist by training, Dr. Puthawala earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Linguistics from Binghamton University and the University of Chicago. He completed his doctorate at the Ohio State University by exploiting mathematical, experimental, and computational methods to study the memory and cognitive mechanisms that determine how humans process ellipses: when words or phrases are missing from an utterance but it is nonetheless understood to express a full sentence. He joined the Wagner lab as a postdoctoral scientist to lend his analytical techniques to problems in the genome, the language of life. Daniel currently leads research into and development of the Categorical Variation Representation Specification (Cat-VRS) for the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) with the aim of alleviating the difficulties that categorical variation poses for genomic knowledge sharing, interpretation, and curation.

His top five fruits are apples, berries (broadly construed), cucumbers, okra, and avocados.
