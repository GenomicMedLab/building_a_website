After graduating from the University of North Florida with a master's in Biology, Anastasia began her doctorate training at the Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program at the Ohio State University in 2022. Some of her current projects in the lab include analyses on the variation and gene normalizer tools. She hopes to use her doctorate to help improve patient care through the standardization and harmonization of genomic data.
