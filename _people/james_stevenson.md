I work as a bioinformatics software developer with the Wagner Lab at Nationwide Children's Hospital's Institute for Genomic Medicine. I'm also pursuing a Master's degree in computer science with a specialization in machine learning at Georgia Tech. In my free time, I'm interested in programming languages, software tools, professional basketball, and continental philosophy.
