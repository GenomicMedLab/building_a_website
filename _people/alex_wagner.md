I am an Assistant Professor in the Institute for Genomic Medicine at Nationwide Children's Hospital and the Department of Pediatrics at The Ohio State University College of Medicine. I am also an NHGRI K99/R00 Scholar, researching methods and tools for normalizing and interpreting the clinical actionability of genomic variants. I support and promote collaborative and open science.
